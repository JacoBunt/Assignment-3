            In the future, I hope to graduate Dal with a bachelor of science in marine biology. From there, I wish to explore possible
            graduate programs perhaps UBC or Guelph. At come point past graduating, I hope to one day own my own research company and hopefully explore 
            large oceans and bodies of water
