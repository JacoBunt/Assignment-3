For functions in the script.js file:

function validateForms(); for this function the purpose is to take the input values and check whether or not they reach the conditions. The form requests the user enter text in the required fields.
The form requests the user enter their first and last name, their e-mail (restricted to Dalhousie students only), phone number (with a regex pattern for North American phone number), and finally a message text are 
for the user to message me about whatever they so choose.

When these inputs are given the function sees if they match the patterns and conditions required, which are as follows:
All fields have a text input
E-mail ends with @dal.ca
Phone number is 10 digits and follows the 3-3-4 digit pattern.

If these conditions are met, a green "Success!" message pops up, indicating a successful submission. If not, the user will receive a red error message indicating what needs to be fixed to meet 
the conditions of the field in question.
